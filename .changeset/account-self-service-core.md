Add framework-independent account registration, sign-in, session resolution and sign-out with exact credential bounds and fixed thirty-day sessions. Session issuance atomically binds to the registered or verified credential so password reset invalidates existing sessions and prevents stale issuance. Interrupted registration fails internally while retaining the account and its replacement credential. Persistence and cryptography remain injected ports; this core does not expose account routes or browser sign-in.
